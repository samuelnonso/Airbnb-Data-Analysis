Airbnb Dataset Analysis

Project Overview: 
This project involves analyzing an Airbnb dataset to extract insights about various aspects of the platform, including listing prices, availability, host credibility, room types, and regions. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be valuable for Airbnb hosts, guests, and business decision-makers.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about various Airbnb listings, such as:

1  Listing details (ID, name, type)

2  Host information (host ID, verified status)

3  Property features (room type, construction year, price)

4  Reviews (number of reviews, review ratings)

5  Availability data (availability throughout the year)

Key Questions Answered:

1  Calculate Total Revenue and Average Revenue per Listing

2  Average Revenue by Region

3  Average Revenue by Room Type

4  Average Revenue by Region and Room Type

5  Impact of Host identity been verified on Estimated revenue

6  What is the Average Availability by Room type?

7  What is the Average Availabilty by Region?

8  What is the Average Availabilty by Region, Room Type & Average Availability?

9  How does Availability Vary Across Room Types or Cancellation Policies?

10  Relative distribution of Average Estimated Revenue across Different room Types

11  Relationship between Room Type, Number of Reviews and Region
    This will answer these two questions:
*  Which Regions drive more guest engagement?

12  Which Room Types benefit the most from being Instant Bookable?

13  In which Regions are Instant Bookable listings most popular (based on Average Number of Reviews), and how does this differ by Room Type?

14  How does the average price per night vary by construction year and region?
